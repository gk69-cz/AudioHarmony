🧠 Design Philosophy – Premium + Exclusive + Audio-Engineered
✨ Design Principles
Generous Spacing & Clean Grid

Use 12-column layout with plenty of breathing room

Apply asymmetrical grid layouts for a modern feel

Use max-width: 1440px container with padding (px-6 to px-10)

Minimal Typography, Bold Hierarchy

Modern sans-serif like Suisse Int’l, Neue Haas Grotesk, or Inter

Strong heading sizes (e.g., 48–64px) + elegant paragraph spacing

Wide tracking for large hero text

Smooth Microinteractions

Hover effects with magnetic motion or 3D tilt on product cards

Scroll-based animations (e.g., reveal sections, parallax backgrounds)

Subtle audio cues on hover/click (optional, low-volume hi-fi feel)

High-Fidelity Imagery

4K-quality speaker renders or product shots with custom lighting

Close-up macro shots of materials (speaker cones, grills, etc.)

Video + Sound as Atmosphere

Use ambient video background (e.g., slow-mo speaker vibrating to bass)

Looping muted audio demo of Zero dB's range (toggle control visible)

🎨 Color Scheme: Light & Dark Theme
⚪ Light Theme
Element	Color
Background	#F5F5F5 (Subtle warm gray)
Primary Accent	#000000 (Jet black)
Secondary Accent	#1E1E1E (Graphite gray)
Highlight Color	#DAA520 (Premium gold hint)
Typography	#0A0A0A (Rich black)
Surface (cards, bg)	#FFFFFF (White)

This creates a high-contrast, clean luxury look with a touch of gold or bronze to imply exclusivity.

⚫ Dark Theme

Background	#0D0D0D (Deep true black)
Primary Accent	#F5F5F5 (Warm off-white)
Secondary Accent	#888888 (Muted metal gray)
Highlight Color	#FFD700 (Gold - slightly glowing)
Typography	#EAEAEA (Soft white)
Surface	#1A1A1A (Satin black)

Dark themes evoke a studio-like, cinematic feel. Ideal for late-night users and pro audio environments.
