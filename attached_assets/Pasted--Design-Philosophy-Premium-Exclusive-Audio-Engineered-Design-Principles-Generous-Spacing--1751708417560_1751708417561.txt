üß† Design Philosophy ‚Äì Premium + Exclusive + Audio-Engineered
‚ú® Design Principles
Generous Spacing & Clean Grid

Use 12-column layout with plenty of breathing room

Apply asymmetrical grid layouts for a modern feel

Use max-width: 1440px container with padding (px-6 to px-10)

Minimal Typography, Bold Hierarchy

Modern sans-serif like Suisse Int‚Äôl, Neue Haas Grotesk, or Inter

Strong heading sizes (e.g., 48‚Äì64px) + elegant paragraph spacing

Wide tracking for large hero text

Smooth Microinteractions

Hover effects with magnetic motion or 3D tilt on product cards

Scroll-based animations (e.g., reveal sections, parallax backgrounds)

Subtle audio cues on hover/click (optional, low-volume hi-fi feel)

High-Fidelity Imagery

4K-quality speaker renders or product shots with custom lighting

Close-up macro shots of materials (speaker cones, grills, etc.)

Video + Sound as Atmosphere

Use ambient video background (e.g., slow-mo speaker vibrating to bass)

Looping muted audio demo of Zero dB's range (toggle control visible)
